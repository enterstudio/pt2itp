## Version History

### v9.24.0

- :rocket: modularizes geocoding capability too
- :tada: adds `--limit` param to `test.js`
- :rocket: weight linker comparisons to deemphasize mismatches based purely on tokens
    - adds `text_tokenless` column to `address_cluster` & `network_cluster` tables
    - handle all-token special case by checking for substring status
- :rocket: detection of candidate address_clusters now uses `ST_Intersects` instead of `ST_Contains`
- :bug: fix JS error in web interface related to features w/o itp data

### v9.23.1

- :bug: Using global tokens would break `test` mode

### v9.23.0
- :tada: Added support for global tokens, for e.g. talstrasse -> tal str, tal strasse
- :white_check_mark: Added tests to make sure this behaviour is followed

### v9.22.1

- :rocket: Remove outdated getNames() call

### v9.22.0

- :rocket: Show street name of viewed feature
- :rocket: Allow searching by lat/lng in search box

### v9.21.1

- :bug: bugfix for zero-distance results in `test.js` mode

### v9.21.0
- :rocket: Reduced the value of the distance in ST_clusterWithin used for network and address clusters, to prevent roads and points far away from each other from being clustered together
- :white_check_mark: added tests to make sure this behaviour is followed

### v9.20.0

- :white_check_mark: Add tests for hooked roads
- :rocket: Take highest/lowest number off end of road into consideration when generating ITP

### v9.19.1

- :rocket: Clean up strip-unit (dup code)
- :rocket: Add in memory number limits

### v9.19.0

- :rocket: Limit precision of coordinates to avoid `NUMERIC` overflows
- :rocket: `number` (civic address) are only allowed to be 10 chars long to reduce bad data - can bump in the future if needed
- :rocket: Unnamed large streets are allowed
- :tada: Add CONTRIBUTING doc to ensure versions are bumped
- :bug: Ensure output of test is prefixed to working dir

### v9.18.0

- :tada: Add diacritic handling to both the test mode & std. `street` field
- rocket: Use `address._text` as definitive name and add `network._text` as syn when they differ
- :bug: Make `psv` files in `lib/copy` have unique names so pt2itp can run in parallel
- :rocket: `test` mode now outputs when network and address text differ as an error

### v9.17.1

- :bug: Don't alter `_text` value with tokens as it is displayed to the user
- :pencil2: Fix `test` mode docs with new options

### v9.17.0

- :rocket: Moves token management to a central shared repo

### v9.16.1

- :bug: Fix bug where assignment wouldn't happen even if score > .4

### v9.16.0

- :bug: Allow `debug` mode from any relative path - use to break as `./web` was hardcoded as static dir
- :tada: remove all `freq` calculations and replace with a much more accurate Liechtenstein distance percent.
  - This change is pretty large and will drastically affect matches in all countries.
  - Before matches were calculated by sorting potentials with the calculated frequency of token matches. This worked well if everything was spelled correctly and helped ensure `st` vs `av` errors still lead to a match. It did however also allow things like `Margaret St` and `Shepherd St` to match on the `ST` token alone.
  - This uses lev. dist to generate a percent with a hard cutoff on if the match can take place or not. From a lot of groking the results 40% matches and above seem like a good first start.

### v9.15.0

- :rocket: Show unmatched addresses in `test` output - these are all bugs/data problems

### v9.8.0

- :rocket: `debug` mode of interpolation.js now writes to `.debug` property with a node for l/r start/end addresses with `left`, `right`, `start`, `end` boolean properties
           this can optionally be consumed by `debug` mode (makes it farrr more useful than without `--debug` flag)
